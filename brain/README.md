## Introduction

This is a modified version of code that can be found on:  
https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning/blob/master/src  

It is a neural network with a single hidden layer (e.g. not a deep learning 
network).

The feature vectors are obtained from the *.dat files in the vault, where each 
.dat file represents a single instance.

## Data Representations

Each instance is represented as the tuple (features, results), where features 
and results are lists of the feature values and result values, respectively.
